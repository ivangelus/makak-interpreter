# makak-interpreter
interpreter based on https://interpreterbook.com/

this project is used for learning purposes, the main idea is having a well sized project that is fun to do and will be used for purposes of learning new programming languages
well sized meaning, once you understand the problem, program can be implemented in the matter of days, but still it can expose you syntax of the language as well as its paradigms
